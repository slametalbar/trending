The project was founded by Karel Albert Rudolf Bosscha, a German-Dutch entrepreneur and philanthropist. His proposal was later approved by the colonial government to meet increasing demand of technical know-how in the colony.<br><br>The school building was designed in 1918 by a Dutch architect named Henri Maclaine Pont by blending Indonesian vernacular architecture with modern elements. The school first opened its doors on 3 July 1920. By then, it only had one active department, the Faculty of Technical Science and one academic major, The Department of Road and Water Resources Engineering.<br><br>During the 1940s, the university rapidly changed hands and experienced various renamings.<br><br>During the Japanese occupation in the World War II and ensuing years, the school was renamed as the Industrial University by the Japanese administration. This name was short-lived as a few years later, the Japanese surrender paved the way for Indonesia's declaration of independence and the campus was renamed as Technical High School by the newly-declared republic.<br><br>A year later, the Dutch colonial government would return to re-occupy Indonesia and took re-directorship of the campus. It was renamed again as Emergency University of Dutch East Indies as the Indonesian National Revolution raged across the colony. It was during this time that the campus would begin operating the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Science under the University of Indonesia.<br><br>On 2 March 1959, the two faculties of University of Indonesia in Bandung was declared a separate academic entity.  Bandung Institute of Technology was founded for higher learning in natural sciences, technologies, and fine arts.<br><br>In 2020, Reini Djuhraeni Wirahadikusumah was appointed as rector of the university until 2025 replacing Kadarsah Suryadi.

Apart from lecture classes and laboratories, the campus boasts an art gallery, a dedicated sports centre, central library, medical clinic and extracurricular areas.<br><br>=== Jatinangor Campus ===<br><br>Due to the increasing number of students, the decision was made to develop another campus elsewhere. The second campus in Jatinangor served as an integral part of the university and is on the same standing as the Ganesha campus. All Freshmen will have their Joint Preparatory Stage (Tahap Persiapan Bersama - TPB) in Jatinangor Campus starting from August 2023.<br><br>=== Cirebon Campus ===<br><br>ITB plans to build a brand-new campus in Cirebon so as to anticipate future research and educational endeavors. This will be the university's commitment in further developing human resources of Indonesia.<br><br>== Rankings ==<br><br>ITB was ranked 281st worldwide in the 2024 QS World University Rankings, and ranked 60th in QS Asian University Rankings 2024. ITB has also been ranked 120–150 worldwide by THE World University Ranking 2023 and 35-40th in the THE Asia University Rankings 2023.<br><br>Domestically, the university is ranked 1st by QS World University Rankings and ranked 1st by Times Higher Education.

This was revealed after an account on Twitter uploaded a photo of a pamphlet containing information on monthly tuition installments managed by a third party. Head of Public Relations ITB, Naomi Haswanto, confirmed that ITB uses financial institutions to help student pay for their tuition and added that the collaboration was carried out using financial institutions that had permission from the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (literally Financial Services Authority; OJK). She also added that the collaboration for paying tuition fees via installments has been implemented with the Danacita platform since August 2023 and stated that several other universities have also provided the option of paying via installments. Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology released a statement and asked the rector of ITB, Reini Wirahadikusumah, to search for a good funding scheme solution after the payment of tuition using an online loan platform went viral and as a mission to provide high quality and inclusive education. OJK asked for an explanation from Danacita as a platform that offers payment of tuition fees in online loan installments.<br><br>On 29 January, hundreds of students marched from the ITB Ganesha campus to the rectorate building as a form of protest against the policy of paying tuition fees using online loan installments. They protested by carrying a number of posters against campus policies which were considered burdensome with the offer of payment via online installments. A number of students then tried to negotiate to meet the ITB rector but it ended in a commotion because they were unable to get the rector to come out and meet the crowd to discuss the problem. Chairman of the KM ITB Cabinet, Muhammad Yogi Syahputra, asked the campus to remove the option of paying via installments which is said to reach Rp. 12,500,000 (USD 790) and demanded to provide a guarantee so that students who had payment arrears could fill out study plan forms which were limited until 30 January. Former Governor of West Java, Ridwan Kamil, said that ITB intentions were good in providing payments using the installment scheme because not all students have the ability to overcome the financial problems they experience. He added that as much as possible, the payment option should not be a burden on students.<br><br>== Awards ==<br><br>Diktiristek Awards 2023: In December 2023, ITB was honored at the Diktiristek Awards 2023, organized by Indonesia's Directorate General of Higher Education, Research, and Technology.
