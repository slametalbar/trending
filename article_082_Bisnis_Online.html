One of these, stambul comedy, is a form of Indonesian folk drama that incorporates Malay cultural influences in the stories told and the language used.<br><br>Although stambul comedy is no longer common, there are other forms of traditional Indonesian comedy which are both traditional and more common such as Ludruk, Lenong, Betawi masks. Non-traditional forms of humorous drama are also performed, such as the comedy of the Srimulat group, which depicts stories of everyday life.<br><br>Nowadays, comedy appears not only in plays but also in films. Some performers participate in comedy troupes making multiple films, such as Warkop DKI (Warung Kopi), comedy group Bagio Cs, and other comedy groups. In these films, the members of the comedy troupe often play leading roles. Indonesians also enjoy comedy produced elsewhere, such as that in the private television broadcast of RCTI and TVRI, which broadcasts such comedies as, such as Kate and Allie, My Two Dads, Golden Girls, all of which are popular in their home country, the United States.

Performers engage in bantering, physical humour, cross-dressing, and socio-political commentary. Examples of popular comedy groups are Srimulat, Jayakarta, Kwartet Jaya, Bagito, Warkop DKI, Patrio, and SQL.<br><br>=== Television ===<br><br>In recent history, the programs with the highest rating in Indonesia have been comedy shows, especially those broadcasts during Eid Mubarak or other fasting periods.  Situation comedy or sketch shows have been common on television since the 1990s. Gara-gara, which first aired on RCTI in 1992, is considered the first situation comedy in Indonesia. Critics attribute the success of this program to its translation of the comedic approach developed by Warkop DKI from film to television. Comedy is also presented in TV programs as part of talent search events. One example of this approach is Stand-Up Comedy Indonesia, a TV program that looks for talent to become comedians or entertainers in the Indonesian film industry.<br><br>=== Film ===<br><br>Successful groups and comedians also branch out to films. The Warkop DKI comedy group has been especially productive, making more than 35 films from 1979 to 1994.

Benyamin Biang Kerok. The comedy elements in several films are found in the main characters. Most of the characters introduce some absurd and physical forms of humor related to aspects of Indonesian cultures or Indonesian people's daily life habits.<br><br>Some comedic films are adapted from popular novels; for example, Raditya Dika was first famous for his book Kambing Jantan, which was made into a feature film.
