        <div>Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used for programming standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications with a bundle of libraries that make project startup and management easier. Spring Boot is a convention-over-configuration extension for the Spring Java platform intended to help minimize configuration concerns while creating Spring-based applications. The application can still be adjusted for specific needs, but the initial Spring Boot project provides a preconfigured &quot;opinionated view&quot; of the best configuration to use with the Spring platform and selected third-party libraries.<br><br><h2>Mengapa Spring Penting?</h2><br><br>Spring Boot can be used to build microservices, web applications, and console applications.<br><br><h2>Spring: Fakta Utama</h2><br><br>== Features ==<br><br>Embedded Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow web application server.<br><br>Provides opinionated 'starter' Project Object Models (POMs) for the build tool. The only build tools supported are Maven and Gradle.<br><br>Automatic configuration of the Spring Application.<br><br>Provides production-ready functionality such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.<br><br>No code generation is required.<br><br>No XML configuration is required.<br><br>Optional support for Kotlin and Apache Groovy in addition to Java.<br><br>== Bootstrapping DispatcherServlet ==<br><br>Spring Boot does not require manual configuration of the DispatcherServlet, since it automatically configures the application based on the configuration it detects.<br><br>=== SpringBootServletInitializer ===<br><br>Spring Boot has a class SpringBootServletInitializer, which is a specialization of the WebApplicationInitializer. This SpringBootServletInitializer is an out-of-the-box implementation of WebApplicationInitializer, which eliminates the need for the developer to construct their own implementation of the WebApplicationInitializer class.<br><br>== Configuration properties ==<br><br>The configuration properties for the Spring Boot application can be specified in the application.properties or application.yml file.<br><br>Examples of properties that can be included in this file include the server.port and spring.application.name properties.<br><br>== Autoconfiguration ==<br><br>=== @SpringBootApplication ===<br><br>Spring boot has an annotation, @SpringBootApplication, which allows the Spring Boot application to autoconfigure third-party libraries and detected features found on the classpath. As an example, the class that has the @SpringBootApplication annotation can extend the SpringBootServerInitializer class if the application is packaged and deployed as a WAR file.<br><br>The @SpringBootApplication annotation combines three Spring-specific annotations: @SpringBootConfiguration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan.<br><br>==== @SpringBootConfiguration ====<br><br>The @SpringBootConfiguration annotation is a specialization of the Spring-specific @Configuration annotation. The class with the @SpringBootConfiguration is marked as the configuration class for the Spring Boot application.<br><br>==== @EnableAutoConfiguration ====<br><br>The @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation is Spring-specific annotation that enables the Spring Boot automatic configuration.<br><br>== Actuator ==<br><br>The Spring Boot Actuator allows for monitoring and management capabilities for the Spring Boot Application. A major advantage of using the Spring Boot Actuator is that it implements a number of production-ready features without requiring the developer to construct their own implementations.<br><br>If Maven is used as the build tool, then the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency can be specified in the pom.xml configuration file.<br><br>== Integration with Spring Framework Modules ==<br><br>Spring Boot has a number of existing Spring Framework Modules.<br><br>=== Spring Security ===<br><br>Spring Boot has integration with the Spring Security Module. The simplest way for integrating Spring Boot with Spring Security is to declare the starter dependency in the build configuration file.<br><br>If Maven is used as the build tool, then the dependency with artifact ID spring-boot-starter-security dependency can be specified in the pom.xml configuration file.<br><br>== Application servers ==<br><br>By default, Spring boot provides embedded web servers (such as Tomcat) out-of-the-box. However, Spring Boot can also be deployed as a WAR file on a standalone WildFly application server.<br><br>If Maven is used as the build tool, there is a wildfly-maven-plugin Maven plugin that allows for automatic deployment of the generated WAR file.<br><br>== References ==<br><br>Deinum, Marten; Cosmina, Iuliana (2021).
