        <h1>Jakarta metropolitan area - Panduan Lengkap 2025</h1>
        <p><small>Terakhir diperbarui: 18 April 2025</small></p>
        <div>The Jakarta metropolitan area or Greater Jakarta, known locally as Jabodetabekpunjur (an acronym of Jakarta–Bogor–Depok–Tangerang–Bekasi further extended to include Puncak region of Bogor Regency and portions of Cianjur Regency) is the most populous megapolitan area in Indonesia. It includes the national capital (Jakarta Special Capital Region, as the core city) as well as five satellite cities and three complete regencies. The original term &quot;Jabotabek&quot; dated from the late 1970s and was revised to &quot;Jabodetabek&quot; in 1999 when &quot;De&quot; (for &quot;Depok&quot;) was inserted into the name following its formation. The term &quot;Jabodetabekjur&quot; or &quot;Jabodetabekpunjur&quot; was legalised on the Presidential Regulation Number 54 of 2008, and then the name &quot;Jabodetabekpunjur&quot; is officially used; however, this extension to include part of Cianjur Regency is not included in the figures below.<br><br><h2>Mengapa The Penting?</h2><br><br>The area comprises Jakarta Special Capital Region and parts of West Java and Banten provinces, specifically the three regencies - Bekasi Regency and Bogor Regency in West Java, and Tangerang Regency in Banten. The area also includes the independent cities of Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang, all of which are not included administratively in the regencies. The name of the region is taken from the first two (or three) letters of each city's name: Ja-bo-de-ta-bek from JAkarta, BOgor, DEpok, TAngerang and BEKasi.<br><br><h2>The: Fakta Utama</h2><br><br>The population of the Jakarta metropolitan area, with an area of 6,822.03 km2 (2,634.00 sq mi), was 31.24 million according to the Indonesian 2020 Census, making it the most populous region in Indonesia, as well as the second-most populous urban area in the world after Tokyo. The Jakarta metropolitan area's share of the national population increased from 6.1% in 1961 to 11.26% in 2010. The population grew further to 32.3 million according to the official mid 2024 Estimates.<br><br>The region is the centre of government, culture, education, and economy of Indonesia. It has pulled many people from throughout Indonesia to come, live and work. Its economic power makes Jakarta metropolitan area the country's premier centre for finance, manufacturing and commerce. According to 2019 data,<br><br>the area had a gross domestic product of US$297.7 billion with a per capita GDP of $8,775, and a purchasing power parity of US$978.5 billion with a per capita PPP of $28,840, equal to 26.2% of economy of Indonesia.<br><br>== History ==<br><br>The region was established in 1976 through Presidential Instruction No. 13 in response to the needs to sustain the growing population of the capital city. Indonesia's government established the Jabotabek Cooperation Body (Badan Kerjasama Pembangunan) of the joint secretariat of Government of DKI Jakarta and West Java province.<br><br>== Greater Jakarta ==<br><br>The generic term Greater Jakarta refers to the urban region surrounding Jakarta, and it is not specific to any official or administrative designations. On the contrary, depending on context, it may refer to the built-up area around Jakarta.<br><br>== Demographics ==<br><br>Among the inhabitants, approximately 10.68 million lived in Jakarta Special Capital Region according to the mid-2024 official estimates; about 9.24 million in the five cities of Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang; and about 12.33 million in the three regencies (Bekasi Regency, Bogor Regency, and Tangerang Regency). The proportion of the core city's (Jakarta) population to that of the entire metropolitan area also declined significantly. In mid 2024, the population of Jakarta was only 33.1% of the total population of the Jakarta metropolitan area, continuing the decline from 54.6% in 1990 to 43.2% in 2000 and 35.5% in 2010. Furthermore, there has been a shift of arrival-destination for incoming migrants from Jakarta to other cities in the Jakarta metropolitan area. Today, about 20% of Indonesia's urban population is concentrated in the Jakarta metropolitan area.<br><br>Sources:<br><br>Census final 2010; Census final 2020; and official estimate as at mid 2024. / Badan Pusat Statistik - Indonesia.<br><br>Indonesia: Table of all administrative divisions/ Citypopulation.de<br><br>Kemendagri 2022 June estimate.  Note the pandemic had a skewing effects on Census 2020 data compared with prior year estimates, in favor of satellite cities, while post-pandemic data indicated a flood back into central cities, but by 2024 this effect was reversed.  This effect was repeated for Bandung, Surabaya, Palembang, and Medan.<br><br>== Economy ==<br><br>Nowadays, the role of the Jakarta metropolitan area in the national economy is still dominant although the decentralisation policy has been implemented since the political reforms in 1998. The region accounts for 25.52% of total national gross domestic product and 42.8% to the total GDP of Java in 2010. Central Jakarta, South Jakarta and Bekasi have respectively accounted for 4.14%; 3.78% and 2.11% of total national GDP. There are three dominant sectors which have a high contribution to the total Jakarta metropolitan area's GDP comprising: industrial sector (28.36%), financial sector (20.66%) as well as trade, hotel and restaurant sectors (20.24%). Based on the contribution of each sector to the total national GDP in 2010, Jakarta metropolitan area contributed 41.87% for the finance sector, 33.1% for construction and building, as well as 30.86% for transportation.<br><br>Prime business and commercial centres include the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; in central Jakarta. There are Indonesia's premier financial centre, SCBD, Mega Kuningan, Rasuna Epicentrum as well as along Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, Jalan M.H. Thamrin, Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto and Jalan HR Rasuna Said. The Golden Triangle is also known to expatriates and locals as a lifestyle centre of the metropolis. There are countless high-end boutiques, fine restaurants, coffee shops and malls. Kelapa Gading is the newest business district, lifestyle centre and residential areas, located in the north-eastern part of Jakarta. It has several bars and entertainment places that open up until late at night.<br><br>The development of large scale residential areas and industrial parks in the Jakarta metropolitan area has been induced by infrastructure development, especially toll roads and railways. The Jakarta metropolitan area has been built industrial estate in the outskirts, mainly in Cikarang, home to a dozen industrial estates with more than 2,500 industrial companies. The Cikarang industrial estate occupied a total land area of about 11,000 hectares and became the largest concentration of manufacturing activities in Southeast Asia. Many foreign companies are located in the Cikarang industrial estate, such as from Japan, South Korea, China, Singapore and United States.<br><br>== Transportation ==<br><br>The region is partly defined by the areas from which people commute into the city. All municipality and regencies have access to toll road and rail service. At present public transport in Greater Jakarta consists of TransJakarta BRT, KRL Commuterline commuter rail, Jakarta LRT, Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link, and Jakarta MRT. The transit system that is currently under construction is LRT Jabodebek. Jakarta LRT began operation by late 2019, and LRT Jabodebek was expected to open by March 2021.<br><br>=== Aviation ===<br><br>The Jakarta metropolitan area has two major airports, Soekarno Hatta International Airport, commonly known as Cengkareng Airport (CGK) and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport (chiefly domestic). Pondok Cabe Airport in South Tangerang, owned by the state oil company Pertamina, is used for civilian and military airport.<br><br>=== Rail ===<br><br>The Jakarta metropolitan area is served by KRL Commuterline, a 418 km (260 mi) commuter train comprising five lines (Red/Bogor Line, Green/Rangkasbitung Line, Blue/Cikarang Loop Line, Brown/Tangerang Line and Pink/Tanjung Priok Line) and over 80 stations across the area, plus Lebak Regency in Banten.<br><br>Urban rail systems in Jakarta include rapid transit system Jakarta MRT, and light rail system Jakarta LRT, and light rapid transit system  Jabodebek LRT. Before Jakarta MRT was opened in 2019, the Jakarta metropolitan area was the world's largest metropolitan areas without a grade-separated rapid transit system.<br><br>Rail connection to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport is served by Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link and Soekarno–Hatta Airport Skytrain inside the airport complex.<br><br>=== Bus ===<br><br>The TransJakarta bus rapid transit service (known as Busway) was developed throughout Jakarta and currently has 13 active corridors and a further three in planning. The system connects Bekasi, Depok, and Tangerang with three routes connecting Jakarta with Bekasi vice versa, namely Harapan Indah - Pasar Baru, West Bekasi - Bunderan HI, and East Bekasi - Tanjung Priok. While for Depok, only three routes are currently active: UI - Manggarai, UI - Lebak bulus, Terminal Depok - BKN via the Cijago toll road. In addition to the main corridors, the feeder buses of Transjakarta serves commuters from satellite cities, such as Bumi Serpong Damai and Bintaro Jaya (South Tangerang) as well as Kemang Pratama, Grand Galaxy City and Cibubur (Bekasi).<br><br>=== High Speed Rail ===<br><br>Indonesia operates a single high-speed rail service between the country's two largest cities, Jakarta and Bandung, branded Whoosh (short for Waktu Hemat, Operasi Optimal, Sistem Hebat, lit. 'Timesaving, Optimal Operation, Excellent System'). It is operated by  Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC).<br><br>Whoosh is the first high-speed railway in Southeast Asia, and the Southern Hemisphere and covers a distance of 143 kilometres (89 mi) with an operating speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), and design speed of KCIC400AF train of 420 km/h (260 mph),<br><br>making it the second fastest commercially operating railway network in the world.<br><br>The travel time between the two cities averages 45 minutes, down from three hours before its opening. Whoosh cost $7.3 billion to build.<br><br>The line began trial operation with passengers on 7 September 2023, and commercial operations on 17 October 2023. The Whoosh high speed train served 1 million passengers during 2 months of commercial operation from 17 October to 25 December 2023.<br><br>== See also ==<br><br>List of metropolitan areas by population<br><br>List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia<br><br>Surabaya metropolitan area<br><br>Bandung metropolitan area<br><br>Medan metropolitan area<br><br>Semarang metropolitan area<br><br>Makassar metropolitan area<br><br>== Notes ==<br><br>== References ==<br><br>== Further reading ==<br><br>Forbes, Dean. &quot;Jakarta: Globalization, economic crisis, and social change,&quot; pp. 268–298, in Josef Gugler (ed.)
